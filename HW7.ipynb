      "source": "# Problem 1. [50 points] Moon Landing\nConsider the vertical (1D) descent of a spacecraft carrying humans onto the lunar surface. The descent phase starts at $t=0$, and the touchdown happens at (free) final time $t=T$. Because of the lack of atomosphere, the spacecraft needs to use thrust to negate free fall due to gravity, and thereby ensure soft landing. \n\n![MoonLandingUrl](https://i.ibb.co/hmKBgXK/Moon-Landing.png)\n\nLet $g$ be the constant (lunar) acceleration due to gravity during the descent. Suppose the mass of the fuel at time $t$ is $m(t)$, which changes over $0\\leq t \\leq T$ since the fuel is burnt to generate the thrust $\\tau = -k\\dot{m}$, where the velocity of exhaust gas w.r.t. the spacecraft is a constant $k>0$. Let $h(t)$ be the altitude of the spacecraft above the lunar surface at time $t$. From Newton's law (force balance), we have\n$$m\\ddot{h} = \\tau - mg = -k\\dot{m} - mg.$$\nThe initial conditions are given: $h(0):=h_{0}>0$, $\\dot{h}(0)=v_{0}<0$, $m(0)=m_{0}>0$. The terminal constraints are: $h(T)=0$, $\\dot{h}(T)=0$; **however $m(T)$ is free**. Here, the control $u$ is the rate of fuel consumption, i.e., $\\dot{m} = u$. The engine imposes the constraint: $-\\alpha \\leq u \\leq 0$, for some known constant $\\alpha>0$.\n\nSince the spacecraft with humans would like to return to Earth, the control objective is to maximize the fuel remaining $m(T)$ at touchdown, i.e., to minimize the fuel consumed: $m_{0} - m(T)$.",

You don't need to prove that. Instead, use this fact and your PMP in (b.1) to **argue in 1 sentence why** the optimal control $u^{*}$ must take extreme values, i.e., $u^{*}(t)\\in\\{-\\alpha,0\\}$ for all $t\\in[0,T]$. However, it is not yet clear how many switchings are possible.\n\n(b.3) It is rather technical to prove that at most one switching is possible in this problem, i.e., $u^{*}$ is bang-bang. You don't need to prove that. Instead, use this information to **show that** the optimal control policy is to **either** use full thrust from $t=0$ to $t=T$, **or** to use a period of zero thrust (free fall) followed by full thrust until touchdown, depending on certain switching curve in the state space.",

Follow download instructions here: http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/ICLOCS/Downloads.html (requires either IPOPT or MATLAB inbuilt fmincon, see detailed instructions in the download page). Check out the \"Example Problems\" tab and its dropdown list. Solve a listed simple example problem to reproduce the plots in the website before coding up our problem in (a.3). Submit (insert in the notebook cell) the plots for the **optimal control and optimal state trajectories** for (a.3) obtained from ICLOCS2.
