See Fig. showing an example scenario for $N=4$.\n\n![PaltooningPurl](https://i.ibb.co/Ytv49vL/Platooning.png)\n\nSuppose that all vehicles have identical discrete time controlled dynamics $x_{i}(k+1) = x_{i}(k) + h (u_{i}(k) - v)$, $i=1,2,...,N$, for time index $k=0,...,T-1$. The parameter $h>0$ is given constant sampling time. The control $u_{i}$ can be thought of as the speed of the $i$th vehicle, and $v$ is a **known speed limit**.\n\nHere is the high level question of interest: what should be the optimal controls such that all consecutive vehicles maintain a separation close to some (known) desired distance $d$ at all times? A separation smaller than $d$ may be unsafe, and thus undesirable. A separation more than $d$ reduces traffic throughput, and therefore also undesirable. We also want all vehicles to move at a speed close to the known speed limit $v$. ",
