To understand the dynamics of bungee jumping shown above, we model the human as point mass $m$ attached at the end of an extensible rope of **unstretched** length $r_0$ (a constant). To account for the elasticity of the rope, we model the rope as a **linear spring** with spring constant $k>0$. Assuming the motion is constrained in a plane and that the acceleration due to gravity $g$ is constant, the dynamics becomes that of a simple pendulum with linear spring; see animation below.\n![SpringPendulumUrl](https://scipython.com/static/media/uploads/blog/double_pendulum/spring-pendulum.gif)  ",
